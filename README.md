## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was great practice for CSS and mobile-first development. I got to sharpen my flexbox positioning skills, while working to keep the site responsive on tablets and mobile devices. Since I started with Frontend Mentor, I have gone from building pages desktop-first to designing them specifically for mobile devices, then adapting them for the desktop.

It also gave me the opportunity to get more familiar with Figma, the webpage layout software. I expect to be using it, or something like it, in my future jobs.


### Continued development

While this project is mostly done, I do want to work on the hero images. I was unable to get them to cut off on the sides like in the examples without messing up my layout. If you have any suggestions, I'd love to hear them!
